## Technologies Used

- React 19
- styled-components
- Ant Design (antd)
- Context API for state management
- Webpack for bundling
- http-server for serving the build

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing

To install the dependencies, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm install

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production to the dist folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.


### `npm run server`

This will serve the contents of the dist folder on a local web server, typically accessible via http://localhost:8080. It's an excellent way to check the production version of your application before deployment.
